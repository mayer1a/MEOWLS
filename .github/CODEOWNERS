# This file exists because as of 2022, GitHub does not offer a mechanism to subscribe to only
# a fraction of new PRs in astropy. Either one chooses to "watch" the entire repository and
# receives a large number of notifications or one needs to manually check for new PRs for
# sub-package(s) of interest.
#
# All names listed here by sub-packages will be requested to review any new PR
# and thus get notified. Only people with maintainer-level permission can be added as
# PR reviewers.
#
# Instructions for core maintainers -- Add your GitHub username to opt-in to automatic
# review requests for specific sub-packages below:

# This owner will be the default owner for everything in repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @mayer1a will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
